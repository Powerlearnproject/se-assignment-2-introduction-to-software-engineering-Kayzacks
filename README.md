What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
Software engineering involves all stages of the software development process, including planning, analysis, design, development, testing, integration, quality assurance, and retirement. It is commonly employed for large and complex software systems rather than individual applications or programs. Whereas trditional programming is the practice of writing and testing code without a process or methodologies such as the SDLC. 

Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):




Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
Phases of the SDLC include, planning: defining the project scope and its objectives for example, outlining the timeline, resources and budget of the project. Requirement gathering: conducting stakeholder interviews and documenting user requirements and system specification. Design: in this phase one would need to define the overall structure and data flow of the project, taking into consideration the user interface and experience. Implementation: in this phase the design specifications are translated into functional software using code/programming. Testing: is the phase where the solution above is executed in a testing UAT to assesst the performance of the solution, track bugs and perform security testing. Deployment: in this phase a training document is created for external users as well as a distribution plan for smooth transition and minimal disruption to the company. Maintenance: continous support is provided in updating and improving the software functionality which includes conducting regular maintenance activities like backups and security updates. 
Agile vs. Waterfall Models:


Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
1. Waterall Model has a linear progression whereby, one phase can only begin once the previous is completed whereas the agile model adopts an iterative approach, it splits projects into sprints which allows for continuous reassessment of progress. 
2. The waterfall model has fixed requirements at the beginning of the project and are expected to remain unchanged which is suitable for a project that has a scope that is well understood and unlikely to change. Whereas the Agile Model has room for flexibility and adaptability of requirements and would be commonly used in fast paced environments like startups.
3. The Waterfall Model, focuses on extensive documentation, whereas the Agile Model prioritizes functional software rather than comprehensive software which will be commonly used in digital agencies where speed is critical. 

Requirements Engineering:

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
Requirements Engineering in SDLC:
1. Requirements Elicitation:
   - Gathering information from stakeholders through interviews, workshops, surveys, and analysis to understand needs and expectation
2.  Requirements Analysis:
   - Refining and prioritizing gathered requirements, resolving conflicts, and assessing feasibility.
3. Requirements Specification:
   - Documenting requirements in a structured format for reference, including user stories and acceptance criteria.
4. Requirements Validation:
   - Ensuring documented requirements accurately represent stakeholder needs through reviews, prototyping, walkthroughs, and testing.
5. Requirements Management:
   - Handling changes to requirements in a controlled manner through version control, change management, traceability, and impact analysis.
Importance of Requirements Engineering in SDLC:
- Foundation for Development: Provides a clear understanding of software objectives and reduces risk.
- Risk Reduction: Identifies potential issues early, reducing rework and delays.
- Improved Quality: High-quality software meeting user expectations.
- Stakeholder Satisfaction: Ensures stakeholder needs are met.
- Cost and Time Efficiency: Avoids scope creep and improves resource planning.
- Facilitates Communication: Acts as a bridge between stakeholders, developers, and project managers.

Software Design Principles:

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
Modularity in software design refers to the practice of breaking down a software system into smaller, independent modules or components. Each module is responsible for a specific functionality or feature of the system. 

Modularity improves maintainability and scalability of software systems in several ways. Firstly, it makes the code easier to understand and maintain because developers can focus on a specific module without having to understand the entire system. This also makes it easier to identify and fix bugs or make updates without impacting other parts of the system.

Secondly, modularity promotes reusability of code. Once a module is developed and tested, it can be reused in other parts of the system or in entirely different projects, which can significantly reduce development time and effort.

Finally, modularity allows for better scalability because new modules can be added or existing ones can be modified without affecting the entire system. This means that as the software requirements change or grow, the system can be easily extended or adapted to accommodate these changes.

Testing in Software Engineering:

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
In software engineering, testing is crucial for ensuring the quality and reliability of a software product. There are different levels of software testing, each serving a specific purpose in the development process:

1. Unit Testing: Unit testing involves testing individual components or units of code in isolation. It helps identify and fix bugs in the early stages of development.

2. Integration Testing: Integration testing focuses on testing the interaction between interconnected units or modules of code. It ensures that the integrated components work together as intended.

3. System Testing: System testing evaluates the behavior of the entire system as a whole. It verifies that all components work together in the intended environment.

4. Acceptance Testing: Acceptance testing is performed to validate whether the software meets the business requirements and is ready for deployment.

Testing is crucial in software development for several reasons:
- It helps in identifying and fixing bugs and defects early in the development cycle, reducing the cost of fixing issues in later stages.
- It ensures that the software meets the specified requirements and functions as intended.
- Testing helps in improving the overall quality and reliability of the software, leading to better user satisfaction.
- It provides confidence to the stakeholders that the software is ready for release.

By employing thorough testing at different levels, software developers can deliver high-quality, reliable, and user-friendly products to their customers.
Version Control Systems:

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
Version control systems (VCS) are tools that help manage changes to source code and other files. They are important in software development because they enable multiple developers to collaborate on a project, track changes, and maintain a history of modifications. VCS also provide features for branching, merging, and concurrent editing, which are essential for large and distributed development teams.
